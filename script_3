# beta is variation between localities (pairwise indexes, or whole-dataset approaches)
# alpha is the diversity of single localities

# we obtain the gamma diversity, but not for the whole dataset, for each of the 2 groups we have created 

# now doing for the whole dataset 
groups<-rep(1,19)
specnumber(comm, groups=groups)
# we obtain total richness of 84, which is what we expected !
