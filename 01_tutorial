## useful functions 
length() ##tells you how many elements are in a particular vector
class() ##indicates what kind of object you are working with
str() ##provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements.

## subsetting vectors 
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")

weight_g[weight_g > 50]
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55] ## where | means "or"

#Missing values (NA)
#You can add the argument na.rm = TRUE to calculate the result as if the missing values were removed 
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. 
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases. 
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
