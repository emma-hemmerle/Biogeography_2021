dat1
summary(dat1)
head(dat1)
tail(dat1)
# to get the type of each variable (column), and type of object (here)
str(dat1)
#  other variable types include characters (text), logical (true or false)
# we get integral and numeric numbers in this case 
#subsetting/indexing, looking at the first 5 columns 
#brackets = alt+shift+(=[]
head(dat1[,1:5])
# selecting row is done by indicating rows before the comma between brackets
dat1[1:6,1:5] #gives you the same results 
# the first dimension is the rows, the second dimension is the columns. 
dat1[1:2,1:3]

# rows correspond to observations, whereas columns are variables, and this is why head() and tail() functions focus on rows 

dim(dat1)
# gives number of rows(1st) and columns (2nd)


comm <- dat1[, -1] #to remove the first column which is just the numbers of the plots 

# species richness is the number of species per plot 
# since our table has percentage cover values, we can determine species richness of a plot by looking at all the values which are bigger than 0. 
comm[1:5,1:5]
comm[1:5,1:5]>0
# we get true/false values 
#summing the value of the rows. in R, true counts as 1, and false counts as 0
rowSums(comm[1:5,1:5]>0)
# for each of the five sites (1st row), we obtain the richness (2nd row). 
rowSums(comm>0)
rowSums(comm[,1:20]>0) # looking at the species richness in all plots, only looking at the first 20 species
rowSums(comm[1:10,]>0) # overall species richness for the first ten plots 

# the function specnumber directly calculates the species richness of your dataframe
specnumber(comm)

# if you just add up the alpha diversity of individual plots, you don't get the species richness of the two plots
# indeed, some species might be present in both plots, and therefore what we obtain in the number of occurences in both plots, not the number of species.
comm[which(comm[,1]>0),] #abis Alba ws present only in the 1st plot, and therefore, here, we obtain all of the abundances of the 1st plot
